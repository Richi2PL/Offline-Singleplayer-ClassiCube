# How to run correctly other version

Extract "Version-selection.zip" and copy the "ClassiCube.js" file to the "Offline-Singleplayer-ClassiCube" folder to replace the original one (All "ClassiCube.js" versions will be on "Version-selection" folder)

# No textures when executing for first time

The game runs with no texture; please just load "default.zip" or "classicube.zip" texture files

Probably I will be updating this every  week
